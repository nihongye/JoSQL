	 * Get the passed in double to the required precision. In essence if you

	 * digit precision then call this method with <code>digits</code> set to 2,
	 * in which case: <b>11.78</b> will be returned. This method is useful when
	 * you want to round a number after a multiple decimal place division.
	 * <p>
	 * In essence it merely rounds the decimal part to the required number of
	 * digits using Math.round.
	 * <p>
	 * This method is most useful when provided in a suitable wrapper, for
	 * instance: <code>
	 *   public float getAsCurrency (float v)
	 *   {
	 * 
	 *       return (float) GeneralUtils.toPrecision (v, 2);
	 * 
	 *   }
	 * </code>
	 * <p>
	 * Note, it is safe to pass 0 as either of the parameters, it should be
	 * noted that passing 0 as <code>digits</code> has the same effect as
	 * calling: Math.round (v), which makes sense since 0 digit precision of
	 * 11.77987 should be 12.

	 * @param v
	 *            The value to round.
	 * @param digits
	 *            The number of decimal digits to round to.
